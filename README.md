# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
Emulated rock-paper-scissors game made using Python. The game follows the rules of rock-paper-scissors. The user gets 5 lives. A life is lost each time they lose against the computer. No lives are gained if the user wins. Game is over when the user loses all 5 lives. 

Made this in computer science for a project, decided to share it.
